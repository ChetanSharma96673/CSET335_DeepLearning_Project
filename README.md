Link: https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php

We employ the ISOT Fake News dataset, which was first made available by the University of Victoria's ISOT Research Lab in Canada. 

This dataset is a collection of thousands of articles, both true and false, that were classified as untrustworthy by Politifact.com and from many reputable news websites. 

The dataset was originally presented as two CSV files, one with phoney news and the other with true news. After merging the dataset, we divided it into test, validation, and training sets using a 64%:16%:20% shuffling ratio.The distribution of data in the training, validation, and test sets from the original combined dataset, which consists of 44,898 data points.
